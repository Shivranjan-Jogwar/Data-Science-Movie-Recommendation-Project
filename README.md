# Data-Science-Movie-Recommendation-Project

## 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  
This project builds a content-based Movie Recommendation System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It helps users find similar movies based on their input preferences.  

### 🔹 Key Features:  
✅ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical form  
✅ Computes Cosine Similarity to find movies with similar descriptions  
✅ User can input a movie name to get personalized recommendations  
✅ Built with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Difflib for efficient matching  

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
🔹 Python (NumPy, Pandas)  
🔹 Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)  
🔹 Difflib for approximate string matching  

### 📌 How It Works:  
1️⃣ Load the movie dataset 📂  
2️⃣ Preprocess the data and extract movie features 🏷️  
3️⃣ Compute similarity scores between movies 🔢  
4️⃣ Recommend movies based on user input 🎥
